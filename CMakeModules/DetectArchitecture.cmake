## DetectArchitecture ##
#[[
Does exactly as it sounds. Detects common symbols defined for different architectures and
adds compile definitions thereof. Namely:
- arm64
- arm
- x86_64
- x86
- ia64
- mips64
- mips
- ppc64
- ppc
- riscv
- riscv64
- loongarch64
- wasm

Unsupported architectures:
- ARMv2-6
- m68k
- PIC

This file WILL NOT detect endian-ness for you.

This file is based off of Yuzu and Dynarmic.
