# Eden Mirror

This is a mirror of Eden, updated periodically--every 20 minutes or so, but GitHub sucks and sometimes it takes longer.

To access the master branch, go [here](https://github.com/eden-emulator/mirror/tree/master)

Remember that Eden's code is hosted at [git.eden-emu.dev](https://git.eden-emu.dev/eden-emu/eden) first and foremost. Pull requests to this repository will not be reviewed.
